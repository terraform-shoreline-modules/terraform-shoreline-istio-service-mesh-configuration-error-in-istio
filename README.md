### About Shoreline
The Shoreline platform provides real-time monitoring, alerting, and incident automation for cloud operations. Use Shoreline to detect, debug, and automate repairs across your entire fleet in seconds with just a few lines of code.

Shoreline Agents are efficient and non-intrusive processes running in the background of all your monitored hosts. Agents act as the secure link between Shoreline and your environment's Resources, providing real-time monitoring and metric collection across your fleet. Agents can execute actions on your behalf -- everything from simple Linux commands to full remediation playbooks -- running simultaneously across all the targeted Resources.

Since Agents are distributed throughout your fleet and monitor your Resources in real time, when an issue occurs Shoreline automatically alerts your team before your operators notice something is wrong. Plus, when you're ready for it, Shoreline can automatically resolve these issues using Alarms, Actions, Bots, and other Shoreline tools that you configure. These objects work in tandem to monitor your fleet and dispatch the appropriate response if something goes wrong -- you can even receive notifications via the fully-customizable Slack integration.

Shoreline Notebooks let you convert your static runbooks into interactive, annotated, sharable web-based documents. Through a combination of Markdown-based notes and Shoreline's expressive Op language, you have one-click access to real-time, per-second debug data and powerful, fleetwide repair commands.

### What are Shoreline Op Packs?
Shoreline Op Packs are open-source collections of Terraform configurations and supporting scripts that use the Shoreline Terraform Provider and the Shoreline Platform to create turnkey incident automations for common operational issues. Each Op Pack comes with smart defaults and works out of the box with minimal setup, while also providing you and your team with the flexibility to customize, automate, codify, and commit your own Op Pack configurations.

# Service Mesh Configuration Error in Istio.

The incident type of "Service Mesh Configuration Error in Istio" refers to a situation where the configuration of the Istio service mesh is incorrect or invalid. This can lead to issues with the routing of traffic within the service mesh, resulting in service disruptions or errors. Service mesh configuration errors can be caused by a variety of factors, such as misconfigured policies or faulty service discovery mechanisms, and can be difficult to diagnose and resolve without careful analysis of the service mesh configuration.

### Parameters

```shell
export NAMESPACE="PLACEHOLDER"
export POD_NAME="PLACEHOLDER"
export COMPONENT_NAME="PLACEHOLDER"
export LOG_FILE_PATH="PLACEHOLDER"
export CONTAINER_NAME="PLACEHOLDER"
export YOUR_CONFIG_FILE="PLACEHOLDER"
export YOUR_DEPLOYMENT="PLACEHOLDER"
```

## Debug

### Check the status of the Istio pods

```shell
kubectl get pods -n ${NAMESPACE}
```

### Check the logs of the Istio sidecar container in a specific pod

```shell
kubectl logs ${POD_NAME} -c istio-proxy -n ${NAMESPACE}
```

### Validate the configuration of the Istio service mesh

```shell
istioctl analyze
```

### Check the configuration of a specific Istio component

```shell
istioctl get ${COMPONENT_NAME} -n ${NAMESPACE}
```

### Restart the Istio pods to apply configuration changes

```shell
kubectl rollout restart deployment -n ${NAMESPACE}
```

### Check the status of the Istio components and their dependencies

```shell
istioctl proxy-status
```

### Check the Istio configuration for a specific workload

```shell
istioctl analyze ${POD_NAME} -n ${NAMESPACE}
```

### Check the Kubernetes events related to Istio

```shell
kubectl get events -n ${NAMESPACE}
```

## Repair

### Identify the source of the configuration error by reviewing the Istio configuration files and logs.

```shell
#!/bin/bash

# Define variables
NAMESPACE=${NAMESPACE}
POD=${POD_NAME}
CONTAINER=${CONTAINER_NAME}
LOG_FILE=${LOG_FILE_PATH}

# Get logs from container
kubectl logs -n $NAMESPACE $POD $CONTAINER > $LOG_FILE

# Search logs for configuration errors
grep -i "configuration" $LOG_FILE

# Additional commands for reviewing Istio configuration files
# kubectl get configmap istio -n istio-system -o yaml
# kubectl get virtualservices -n ${NAMESPACE} -o yaml
```

### Correct the configuration error by modifying the Istio configuration files as necessary.

```shell
#!/bin/bash

# Define the variables
NAMESPACE=${NAMESPACE}
DEPLOYMENT=${YOUR_DEPLOYMENT}
CONFIG_FILE=${YOUR_CONFIG_FILE}

# Retrieve the current Istio configuration
kubectl get deployment $DEPLOYMENT -n $NAMESPACE -o yaml > deployment.yaml

# Modify the configuration file as necessary
sed -i 's/old-value/new-value/g' $CONFIG_FILE

# Update the Istio configuration
kubectl apply -f $CONFIG_FILE -n $NAMESPACE

# Verify that the corrected configuration has been applied correctly
kubectl rollout status deployment $DEPLOYMENT -n $NAMESPACE
```
